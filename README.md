# Supply-chain-management
This project targets the supply and demand misalignment witnessed by an FMCG company in its instant noodles business over the past two years. The company faces critical challenges in its current supply chain, with high-demand regions encountering insufficient supply, resulting in missed sales opportunities, and low-demand regions grappling with excess inventory costs. The primary objective of this optimization initiative is to strategically synchronize the supply quantity in each warehouse nationwide with the local demand for instant noodles. The ultimate goal is to minimize inventory costs, elevate customer satisfaction, and bolster overall operational efficiency.
